# Currency Exchange App

This was created as a project for Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy.

This project uses Node.js with Express for the server, Axios to make HTTP requests, and EJS as the templating language.

I have used a free api from [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to request currency codes and exchange rates.

To start this server:
- you will need to get a free api key from the provider and put it in the variable in the server.js file.
- you can then use npm i to install the node modules
- then use nodemon to start the server


Enjoy!
